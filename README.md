# Orace Teck Days 2023 - NgRx new
## About today
In this seminar, we will talk about `Redux`. Specifically, we will discuss one, very popular, implementation of redux for Anguar: the `NgRx` suite. What special about this suite is the approach it takes to `Redux`. It combines the principals of `Redux` with Functional Programming, and Reactivity, to form an elegant solution.

Even in this package, there are today 3 different solutions. In this seminar we will talk about 2 of them. 
- The `@ngrx/store` The classic one, the one with which it all started and that's been popular for several years now.
- The `@ngrx/signals` The brand new one, the one that takes advantage of Angular's latest feature: `Signals` to provide a modern, super elegant, solution.
